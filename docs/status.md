### Project Status

Our __open source projects__ contain one out of four status label:
\
\
``✅ Active:`` Project is in active development.\
``⚠️ Inactive:`` Project is temporarily unmaintained.\
``⏩ Moved:`` The project has been moved to a new location.\
``⛔ Discontinued:`` Project is no longer in development. New issues and pull requests are no longer accepted.
\
\
Regardless of the project status, we look forward that existing releases will remain available on GitHub.
