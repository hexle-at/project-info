### Project Status
<br>
Our ``open source projects`` contain one out of four status label:
<br><br>
✅ ``Active:`` Project is in active development.<br>
⚠️ ``Inactive:`` Project is temporarily unmaintained.<br>
⏩ ``Moved:`` The project has been moved to a new location.<br>
⛔ ``Discontinued:`` Project is no longer in development. New issues and pull requests are no longer accepted.
<br><br>
Regardless of the project status, we look forward that existing releases will remain available on GitHub.
